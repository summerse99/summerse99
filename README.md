- 👋 Hi, I’m Emily (@summerse99)
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering and Development Positions. My repositiories on here have had some usefulness in the past or are pulled and altered from previous app development. 
- 🌱 My strongsuit is Java, but I have experience in Python, C++, and FrontEnd(html/javascript/css). I'm currently focusing my time on developing a passion project mobile app.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI projects or pretty much anything
